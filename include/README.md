# Headers

Library headers should be placed within this folder adding nested folders when
necessary to better organize the file structure.

It is advised to separate the function declarations from other definitions (such
as macros, types, constant, etc...) into two different files, respectively:
- `<filename>-api.h`
- `<filename>.h`
