# Unit tests

To test the library one test file for each source file should be created with
the `test-` prefix.
The file structure may be kept the same as the one in the `src` folder to keep
the structure consistent.

To run the unit tests it is needed to create a separate project including the
library as a dependency, and copy or link the test files inside the project
`test` folder.
